## 𝐂𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐢𝐰𝐚𝐥𝐢 𝐢𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐚𝐟𝐭𝐞𝐫 11 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐭’𝐬 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 !

From 2011 until last year we celebrated Diwali in the U.S. I’ve returned to a superbly tech enabled India.

The pandemic accelerated digital adoption and thus opened up new growth opportunities for small to big Indian companies.

In the last few years India has developed the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world. Many tech start ups have established a strong presence in India and want to expand internationally.

This also means there needs to be a sharper focus on equipping the Indian talent pool with the right skill set. That’s where learning professionals like me come in and help.

As a consumer too I couldn’t be happier. Among so many tech enabled services

My top three:

1️⃣ I don’t use cash or card to make payments, it’s all online on my phone. Thanks to online payment apps , even gardeners and cleaners in the city are accepting monthly salaries and Diwali bonus online. 

Use of QR codes is unbelievably common, sorry I hadn’t seen this anywhere else before. Initially my driver would tell me not to pull out my wallet as all local shops have QR codes at the cashier. I am yet to see such widespread adoption of an online payment app even in Silicon Valley.

2️⃣We got Diwali deep cleaning done by professionals using an app. You clap 👏 and they get local service providers at your door step. It is such a luxury for someone like me. 

3️⃣I don’t need a Genie 🧞‍♂️to quickly get me items for any last minute Diwali preparations. There is a popular app that gets you local items in the blink of an eye , within less than 30 mins. Only if I could use this app in the suburb I live in the U.S. or during my travel to Europe or other Asian countries. 

But for now my only wish from a genie is to help clear out the pollution and traffic from my city, Gurugram.

Wish you and your loved ones a happy Diwali !
